Hi, I’m **Ding Yi**.  This is a relaxed yet somewhat informative, personal place where I share subjective content. The website may contain:

1. Some content related to earthquake engineering - professional knowledge (probably not many people will read 😑)
2. A little bit of programming tutorials - Python, Matlab ... (more like notes than tutorials)
3. Records and sharing of efficiency tools that have been tinkered with
4. Some life insights and summaries

### R E S E A R C H    C O N T E N T
+ AI for Earthquake Engineering
	+ Physics-driven deep learning for seismic wave modeling
	+ Seismic numerical simulation
+ Strong ground motion characteristics
	+ Nonlinear Soil Behavior on Site Response
	+ Borehole spectral ratio; HVSR;
	+ seismic interferometry

When I was a kid, I thought I was SpongeBob, but when I grew up, I realized I was Squidward. 

> "The older we get, the more we understand this guy". 

But I think Squidward is actually better than most of us. Because, although he works in a job he doesn't like, he still practices his musical 🎼 instrument 🎻 at home, paints, dances and sculpts... He didn't let the job define him. There’s nothing more beautiful than a smile that struggles through tears.
